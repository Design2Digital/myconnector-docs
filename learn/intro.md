# MyConnector Overview

MyConnector is a Syndication Platform that enables businesses to easily move and syndicate data between systems, as well as use configured workflows to syndicate or collate data from multiple sources.

We never store data, we only store your credentials to access external systems (such as Touch Base Pro or Hubspot), once they have been stored by us they will never be seen by anyone.
