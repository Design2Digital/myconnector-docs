# Workflows Intro

Myconnector Workflows allow you to post any data to any single or multiple destinations that you have asked us to configure.

For example, say you have a wordpress site with a form to submit a contact us request. Your marketing team would like to automatically send the form data to their CRM at [Hubspot](https://www.hubspot.com/).

We provide you with a URL and API key. You can then use it in your form to submit the data and optionally also send it elswhere yourself. We can also configure the Workflow to send the data through multiple channels.
